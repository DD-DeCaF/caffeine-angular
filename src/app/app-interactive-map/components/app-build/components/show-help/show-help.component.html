        <h2>Constraint-based modeling</h2>
        <p>The following simulation methods predict metabolic fluxes that optimize certain biological objectives, for
          example, growth yield. They operate under the assumption that the organism’s metabolism is in a dynamic
          equilibrium (pseudo steady-state): internal metabolite concentrations are constant and production and
          consumption fluxes perfectly balance each other.<br>
          This is a reasonable assumption when the environment is constant (e.g. in a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemostat">chemostat</a>) or there is nutrient excess (e.g. a microbial
          culture growing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_growth#Phases">exponential phase</a>).</p>
        <p>Physiological data (uptake and secretion rates, yields, growth rates, C13 fluxes etc.) can all be readily
          integrated in the form of reaction rate constraints. In the future, the integration of additional types of
          omics data will be added.</p>
        <p>You can find a comprehensive overview of constraint-based modeling and its applications <a
          href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415005681?via%3Dihub">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)</h3>
        <p>Flux balance analysis optimizes a biological objective to predict a distribution of metabolic fluxes. The
          default objective is the maximization of growth rate.</p>
        <p><strong>Caveats</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In general, flux distributions predicted through FBA are not unique. Uncertainties in the predicted fluxes
            can be assessed through <a href="http://cobramethods.wikidot.com/flux-variability-analysis">Flux Variability
              Analysis</a> (see also below).
          </li>
          <li>Biomass composition is assumed to be constant and growth-rate independent.</li>
          <li>The objective is optimization of growth yield and not growth rate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Parsimonious FBA (recommended)</h3>
        <p>In addition to maximizing growth yield (see FVA below), <a href="http://cobramethods.wikidot.com/pfba">Parsimonious
          Flux Balance Analysis</a> (pFBA) will simultaneously minimize the sum of all fluxes which is a proxy for
          minimizing enzyme expression.</p>
        <p><strong>Caveats</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Flux minimization is only a proxy for the minimization of protein expression cost. For more accurate
            modeling approaches to proteome allocation, please refer to the <a
              href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.15252/msb.20167411/abstract">GECKO</a> method (already
            supported for <em>S. cerevisae</em>) and <a href="http://msb.embopress.org/content/9/1/693">ME</a> models
            (which will be made available soon).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Flux Variability Analysis (FVA)</h3>
        <p>In general, constraint-based modeling solutions will have many alternative optima. <a
          href="http://cobramethods.wikidot.com/flux-variability-analysis">Flux Variability Analysis</a> (FVA) allows
          the estimation of the uncertainty in flux predictions computed by FBA. Uncertain reaction rates are
          highlighted using transparency.</p>
        <h3>Parsimonious FVA</h3>
        <p>Similar to FVA, parsimonious FVA will estimate the uncertainty of flux predictions computed by pFBA.</p>
